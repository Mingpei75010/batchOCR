# batchOCR
Batch OCR processing based on Baidu AI Cloud

This is a simple program to help you transfer pictures into words(Optical Character Recognition, OCR). For example, you can transfer a pdf file into jpg files, name them as the instructions below, then you can use my program to do batch OCR processing.

Some requirements before running BatchOCR.py:
- aip module are needed, which you can use 'pip install baidu-aip' command to install it.
- you need to register Baidu AI Cloud and get APP_ID, API_KEY and SECRET_KEY and fill them in BatchOCR.py.
- Rename your pictures as pic1.jpg, pic2.jpg, ... , picn.jpg, then set range=n in line 4.

I hope this program will help you one day :)
